2. Cloud Cover Impact:
   - Clear skies (0-15%): Perfect stargazing conditions
   - Partly cloudy (15-50%): Intermittent viewing opportunities  
   - Mostly cloudy (50%+): Limited observing potential

3. Atmospheric Transparency Examples:
   - Excellent: Faint deep-sky objects visible
   - Good: Most star clusters and nebulae visible
   - Fair: Bright stars and planets only
   - Poor: Only brightest objects visible

4. Seeing Conditions:
   - Excellent seeing: Steady stars, high magnification possible
   - Good seeing: Minimal twinkling, good for deep-sky objects
   - Poor seeing: Heavy twinkling, planetary detail difficult

5. Equipment Setup for Different Conditions:
   - Dew prevention strategies
   - Cold weather considerations
   - Wind protection methods
