## 🎯 What is Climatology?

Climatology is an advanced weather prediction platform that forecasts spectacular natural phenomena with scientific precision. Our proprietary algorithms analyze atmospheric conditions to predict when and where nature's most beautiful displays will occur.

### 🔥 Currently Available
- **Fire Sky** - Breathtaking sunset and sunrise predictions
- **Quality Index** - Spectacle intensity forecasting  
- **AOD Analysis** - Atmospheric clarity assessment
- **Multi-Model Support** - ECMWF and GFS data integration

### 🚀 Coming Soon
- ☁️ **Sea of Clouds** - Mountain cloud formations
- 🌈 **Rainbow** - Optimal rainbow conditions
- 🌫️ **Fog** - Mystical fog phenomena  
- ⭐ **Starry Sky** - Astronomical visibility
